# ChatGPT 3.5 Piano Composer ðŸŽ¹

## How It Works
Use the following <b>prompt</b>:
"Hello, can you generate piano music? Write 200 elements in the following format: offset quartelength list of notes. Each element would be represented as a chord, so you can include from 1 to 10 notes for each element (use a different number of notes for each chord). The list of notes could be a single note. Quartelength is a number from 0 to 4. Offset represents the offset in relation to the beginning of the song."

## Usage
1. Save the answer to your prompt in the file notes.txt.
2. Convert the text to a MIDI file using the ```gpt_composer.ipynb``` notebook.

## Experiment and Enjoy!
Feel free to tweak the prompt and explore the endless possibilities of creating unique piano compositions with ChatGPT 3.5. Happy composing! ðŸŽ¶
