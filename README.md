## How It Works
Use the following prompt:
"Hello, can you generate piano music? Write 200 elements in the following format: offset quartelength list of notes. Each element would be represented as a chord, so you can include from 1 to 10 notes for each element (use a different number of notes for each chord). The list of notes could be a single note. Quartelength is a number from 0 to 4. Offset represents the offset in relation to the beginning of the song."

## Usage
